            <span>ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Aryan Tiwari, a passionate B.Tech student hailing from the vibrant campus of IERT in Prayagraj. With a keen interest in technology, I thrive on diving deep into the realms of programming, <strong>Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)</strong>, <strong>Database Management Systems (DBMS)</strong>, <strong>Computer Networks (CN)</strong>, and various other core subjects.</span>
            <br />
            <br />
            <span>On the development front, I specialize in leveraging the power of <strong>MERN</strong> (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, coupled with the dynamic <strong>Next.js</strong> framework. Whether it's crafting sleek user interfaces or architecting robust backend systems, I find joy in bringing ideas to life through code.</span>
            <br />
            <span>Driven by curiosity and fueled by a thirst for knowledge, I'm constantly exploring new horizons in the ever-evolving world of technology. When I'm not glued to my screen, you can find me tinkering with gadgets, exploring nature's beauty, or engaging in stimulating discussions about the latest tech trends.</span>
            <br />
